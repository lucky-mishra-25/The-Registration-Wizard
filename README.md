## 🎨 Progress Bar Logic

The progress bar updates dynamically when:
- Clicking **Next**
- Clicking **Previous**

JavaScript controls:
- Step activation
- Progress width calculation
- Form validation

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Download or clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/registration-wizard.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each step is wrapped inside a `.step` container.
- Only one step is visible at a time.
- Active steps receive the `active` class.
- Progress bar width is calculated based on:
  
  ```
  (currentStep / totalSteps) * 100
  ```
